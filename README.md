1.        A feature in software you are building requires the ability to take an arbitrary list of numbers greater than 0, and print their sum.
a.       Implement this function.
b.       A new requirement comes in from your manager that now says, that he only wants the function to print the sum of the numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 5.  Update your existing function to satisfy this new requirement.
c.       Another new requirement comes in that the function must now be able to print the sum of numbers that are divisible by either 3 or 5 OR print the sum of numbers that are divisible by 4.  Update your function.
d.       Finally,  another requirement comes in that the function must now be able to print the sum of numbers that match any arbitrary condition.
 
2.       I’ve attached a ruby script that contains a test suite.  Without changing the test suite in any way, can you write the code required to make the test suite pass all 8 tests?  You can run the test suite simply by executing “ruby test.rb”.  Hint: run the script test suite without adding any code and use the errors to give you an idea of where to start.
